# SKC - System and Project Automation Tool

## Overview
SKC is a lightweight command-line tool designed to help developers automate common system and project setup tasks. It provides predefined scripts for starting Flask and Next.js projects, creating virtual environments, and retrieving system information.

## Features
- **Flask Boilerplate**: Quickly set up and start a Flask project.
- **Next.js Boilerplate**: Easily initialize and run a Next.js application.
- **Virtual Environment Management**: Create a Python virtual environment if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
- **System Information**: Retrieve key system details such as OS type, processor, IP address, and user information.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skc.git
   ```
2. Run the `setup.bat` script for easy access, making SKC globally accessible:
   ```sh
   setup.bat
   ```
3. Use `skc` in any desired directory to execute commands.

## Usage
Run `skc` followed by a task name to execute the corresponding action.

```sh
skc [task]
```
